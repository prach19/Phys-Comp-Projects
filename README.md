All my works created with microcontrollers and electronics

## Thermo-glove
- Thermo-glove is my attempt at creating a wearable electronic that senses temperature changes in the environment. This piece uses an Arduino, temperature sensor, and multiple LEDS to notify users when their environment is too hot, too cold, or “just right”. This was one of my first projects with an Arduino, before I learned how to solder wires and create more robust electronics. This project sparked an interest in creating more wearable in the future as it combines my passions for textile art and engineering.

## Swamp Thing
- Swamp Thing is an interactive sculpture created by myself, Tina Hokmi and Alexis Estropia. Swamp Thing is a piece that is meant to pique viewers’ curiosity and test their ability to trust an unknown creature. This “creature” from another planet is enclosed in an environment of dirt, leaves, and moss. Viewers interact with the creature by looking into the viewing tubes and reaching into its structure to feel it. When viewers interact with the piece, Swamp Thing’s vines begin to shake, its enclosure glows, and it begins to breathe heavier.
- This piece was created in an iterative process, starting with each creator testing the functionality of the interactive components, then building a bare bones prototype and, eventually, ending up with a robust, finished sculpture.
- Created with multiple Arduinos, sensors, LEDs and craft supplies, this sculpture was featured in York University’s [Digital Media End-of-Year showcase in 2023](https://dmgallery.apps01.yorku.ca/digital-media-eoys-2023/).
